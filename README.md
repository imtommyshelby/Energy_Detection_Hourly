## About

Welcome to the Energy Detection Hourly repository! This project focuses on analyzing and predicting hourly energy consumption in various US states. The goal is to gain insights into energy consumption patterns and develop predictive models that can assist in energy management and planning.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption). It includes hourly energy consumption data for different US states. Please download and preprocess the data before using it with this project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imtommyshelby/Energy_Detection_Hourly.git
cd Energy_Detection_Hourly
```
2. Install The Required Dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage
- Prepare the dataset: Download and preprocess the hourly energy consumption dataset from Kaggle.

- Place the dataset in the data folder.

- Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory to analyze the data, build predictive models, and visualize results.
